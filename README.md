# Next.js Todo App üìù

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app, featuring CRUD operations for todos, server-side rendering for better performance, dark theme functionality, API routes, and MongoDB integration using TypeScript and Next.js 14.

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

pnpm dev

bun dev

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app in your browser.
